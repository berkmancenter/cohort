Hey Daniel, my git-fu is very weak and I realized I commited the rdocs along with all the commenting I did to make them. So the diffs aren't as useful now. Here is a list of all the stuff I did RDocs on:

Controllers:
  contact_cart_controller
  freemailer_campaigns_controller
  bulk_action_controller
Helpers:
  freemailer_campaigns_helper
Models:
  contact_cart
  freemailer
  freemailer_campaign
  freemailer_campaign_contact
Views I worked on:
  *.haml
  _bulk_contact_actions.html.erb
